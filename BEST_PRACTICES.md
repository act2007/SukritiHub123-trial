# Best Practices for SukritiHub123

This document outlines the best practices and coding standards to follow when working on this project.

## Authentication and Security

### Environment Variables
- **Never hardcode API keys or secrets** in the codebase
- Always use environment variables for sensitive information
- Use the `.env.example` file as a template for required environment variables
- Validate environment variables at startup and fail fast if required variables are missing

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors in authentication flows
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed error information for debugging (but be careful not to expose sensitive data)
- Implement proper recovery strategies for authentication failures

## Code Structure

### Logging
- Use the `createLogger` utility from `src/lib/logger.ts` for all logging
- Create module-specific loggers for context-aware logging
- Avoid using `console.log` directly in production code
- Log at appropriate levels (debug, info, warn, error)

### TypeScript
- Use proper TypeScript types for all variables and functions
- Avoid using `any` type when possible
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use generics for reusable components

### Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments to all functions and complex types
- Include parameter descriptions and return value information
- Document any side effects or potential errors

## Database

### Schema Conventions
- Use snake_case for all table and column names
- Avoid spaces in table and column names
- Use consistent naming patterns across related tables
- Define foreign key relationships explicitly

### Query Optimization
- Use joins instead of multiple sequential queries when possible
- Batch related queries to reduce round trips to the database
- Use indexes for frequently queried columns
- Be mindful of N+1 query problems

### Data Access
- Centralize database access in dedicated service modules
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Use transactions for operations that modify multiple tables

## React Best Practices

### Component Structure
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable UI elements into separate components
- Use React hooks for stateful logic
- Follow the container/presentation component pattern

### Performance
- Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders with `React.memo` and `useCallback`
- Implement proper loading states for asynchronous operations
- Use code splitting for large components

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state that changes infrequently
- Consider using a state management library for complex state
- Keep state as local as possible
- Use the reducer pattern for complex state logic

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for all critical business logic
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Test error handling paths
- Aim for high test coverage of core functionality

### Integration Tests
- Test key user flows end-to-end
- Verify that components work together correctly
- Test authentication flows thoroughly
- Include edge cases and error scenarios

## Deployment

### CI/CD
- Set up continuous integration to run tests on every commit
- Use automated deployments for consistent releases
- Include linting and type checking in the CI pipeline
- Implement staging environments for pre-production testing

### Monitoring
- Set up error tracking in production
- Monitor performance metrics
- Implement logging for critical operations
- Create alerts for unusual behavior or errors
